# Predicting-Diabetes-ML-Project-
Support Vector Machine Classifier ML model

This project is based on using the Support Vector Machine Classifier ML model on the PIMA Diabetes dataset in order to determine if the patients within the dataset are considered to be diabetic or not. I have explained within the project the steps I undertook in order to create a predictive system which successfully classifies a particular patient as diabetic or not diabetic.

The main steps undertaken for this project are as follows:

1) Importing correct packages and ML models to be used
2)Data Preprocessing
3)Run Support Vector Machine Classifier ML model and predict whether the patient is diabetic or not.
